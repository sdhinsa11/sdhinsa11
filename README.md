Hi! My name is Sohana and I am a computer science student at the University of Alberta! 
I am very new to this world, I only know python but I am excited to learn more. 
I am involved in a couple of projects and by End of November/ beginning of December I hope to share them! 
If you want to reach out this is my email: sohanadhinsa@gmail.com
Thank you!!
